# Linear_Regression_Scratch
Implementation of Linear Regression in python from scratch

This includes implementation of Linear regression from scratch by using all the mathematical formulas.
The goal of linear regression is to find a line that best fits a set of data points. There are following steps
1. Randomly initialize parameters for hypothesis function
2. Compute mean squared error
3. Calculate the partial derivative
4. Update the parameters based on derative and learning rate
repeat 2 - 4 until error is minimized or in other words we reach global minima
